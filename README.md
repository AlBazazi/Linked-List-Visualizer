# Linked-List-Visualizer
GUI based representation of a Linked List with basic operations made using Java Swing.

The project provides a graphical representation of a linked list with automatic assignment of a number from a pool of 100 imitating a memory address for each node. Each node is connected to the other and contains the address to the next node it points to. As of now, only integers are taken as input though it may be expanded to include other data types.
