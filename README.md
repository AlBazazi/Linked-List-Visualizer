# Linked-List-Visualizer
GUI based representation of a Linked List made using Java Swing (Only allows Integers as Input)

This is a third semester project for the course "Data Structures and Algorithms". The project provides a graphical representation of a linked list with automatic assignment of a number from a pool of 100 imitating a memory address for each node. Each node is connected to the other and contains the address to the next node it points to. As of now, only integers are taken as input though it may be expanded to include other data types.
